=========

Web-proxy script built on PHP, Symfony and Curl



#### Installation

Keep in mind that this is a **project** and not a library. Installing

```shell
composer create-project athlon1600/php-proxy /var/www/
```

If you're on a host that doesn't provide shell access, then download a pre-installed version of php-proxy from the official website: [PHP-Proxy.com](https://www.php-proxy.com)

#### Configuration

You can either write and inject your own plugins or edit config.php file that deals with all already pre-installed plugins.
